# Main Responsibilities
- Configure LAN with few host devices.
- Implement structured cabling using wall mount and patch panel

# Concepts Worked With 
- DHCP 
- DNS 
- LAN Networks
- Structured Cabling

# Troubleshooting 
Initially after connecting one host machine to the LAN, I had to verify the connection by visiting office.srv on a web browser. I kept getting the error "host name unresolved"

This was not part of the lab so I had to do some investigating online. It turns out that the office server's DNS service was inactive. The machine could not resolve office.srv with the server's correct ip address. I just configured the dns record and everything worked properly.

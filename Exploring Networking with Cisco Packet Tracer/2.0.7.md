# Main Responsibilities
- Add new switch to office network
- Connect computer to the LAN

# Topics Explored 
Patch Panels and Wall Mounts
- Took a deeper look into patch panels, and punch downs. 
- For simpler and smaller scale networks with nearby devices (like at home), they may be simple to forgo, but for larger networks with many devices connected via ethernet, direct switch connection may be unviable. In this case, using a patch panel offers increase organizational benefits. 
- Explored videos that show patch panel setup.
- Learned about modular and coupler patch panels
